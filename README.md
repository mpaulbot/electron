Electron wrapper to make desktop releases for the game

You can download the latest version of Tough Love Arena on the [Releases page](https://github.com/mpaulbot/electron/releases)

IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE

- The Tough Love Arena desktop application is no different from the website [toughlovearena.com](https://toughlovearena.com)
- The desktop application is designed to assist those who wish to play offline or on the go
- The game will check for updates on startup and then every 5 minutes
- If there's been an update, you will see a notification telling you to close the application so it can update itself
- An official release via Steam is planned, but not ready yet
